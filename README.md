This repo implements LS GAN with training dataset is LSUN dataset(church)

it contains:
1. data_loader.py supports pytorch data loader
2. model.py defines generator and discriminator
3. train.py
4. utils.py provides necessary libraries

Finally, in inference.py, you are able to run generator to create fake images, please check carefully several paths.
I provided temporary checkpoint in folder "checkpoint/", but note that the training process has been continuous and I will update the latest checkpoint via Google drive link:
